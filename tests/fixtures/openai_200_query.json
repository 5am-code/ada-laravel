These habitats are envisioned as lush environments where traditional forest ecosystems intersect with extensive networks of digital information. The Silicon Forests are rich in biodiversity and saturated with digital data streams that permeate the atmosphere and soil. Elements of ambient technology, such as data nodes and low-energy servers, are integrated into the landscape, contributing to the biogeochemical cycles and providing a unique niche for the PHP Elephant to thrive."
